# Python Projects

Many of the scripts in this repository were made when I was just learning python. They are great to learn the basics of Python and I found most of them on [practicepython.org](https://www.practicepython.org/).

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the following dependencies

- numpy

Then, run

```bash
python path_to_your_script
```

## How to Use

This repository contains games which can be played in the console, utilities like a password generator, and math problem solvers. You can run any script induvidually.
